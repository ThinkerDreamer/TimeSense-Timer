## About

I created this elegant visual timer to help myself and other people like me who struggle with **time blindness** visualize exactly how much of the allotted time has passed and how much is remaining.

Before starting this project, I looked for Android and web apps for visual timers and couldn't find any that were attractive and exactly what I was looking for, so I created my own.

I originally wrote it in vanilla JavaScript, taking reference from from  [Mateusz Rybczonek's Animated Countdown Timer](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-animated-countdown-timer-with-html-css-and-javascript/), but I added many of my own touches to the timer's interface, such as:
- blinking numbers while paused
- buttons which hide while the timer is in use (original vanilla JS version only, still to be added to React version)
- a pop-out button to create a mini-version of the timer

I also crafted the styling to make it responsive for all screen sizes. 

I later ported it to React as practice while learning the framework, though now (Jan 2025) after a few years of professional software engineering experience under my belt, I feel it could have stayed in, well, not JavaScript, but TypeScript, without the added complexity of React, which adds little benefit in this case.

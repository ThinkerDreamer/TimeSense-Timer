I created this elegant visual timer to help myself and other people like me who struggle with **time blindness** visualize exactly how much of the allotted time has passed and how much is remaining.

Before starting this project, I looked for Android and web apps for visual timers and couldn't find any that were attractive and exactly what I was looking for, so I created my own.

I got the code for the SVG animation from the tutorial above, but I added many of my own touches to the timer's interface, such as:
- blinking numbers while paused
- buttons which hide while the timer is in use
- a pop-out button to create a mini-version of the timer

I also crafted the styling to make it responsive for all screen sizes.
